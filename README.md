# Access.io
## How do I run it?
- 1.) Add Access.io to Eclipse (download through Eclipse's Git via the HTTP URI found on Github)
- 2.) Make sure the project is named CSCI201_Group_6
- 3.) Right click on the project and go to Properties -> Project Facets, and make sure that Dynamic Web Module and Java Modules are selected. The project should now be a Dynamic Web Project.
- 4.) Add the two jars (gson-2.8.6.jar and mysql-connector-java.8.0.19.jar) to the Build Path Classpath and Deployment Assembly, also found in Properties.
- 5.) Add the project to your Tomcat Server (make sure the port 8080).
- 6.) Turn the server on. The backend is now running and can be connected to the frontend.
